A* Pathfinding.

This implementation of a* is based upon a 2d grid where one can walk horizontally, vertically and diagonally. diagonal walking costs
extra. there is a 20% chance for a node to spawn as a roadblock. Feel free to download the source code and play around with this. 
Or get a better version of this, your choice why are you even here.
